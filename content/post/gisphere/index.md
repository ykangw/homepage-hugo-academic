## Overview

**GISphere Guide** collects timely and comprehensive information on global graduate programs and professors in Geographic Information Science (GIS) and related fields. It contains the most updated information on GIS-related programs and professors from more than 270 universities located in 35 countries and regions across the world. All the information is open-sourced on [GitHub](https://github.com/gisphere/gisphere.github.io).

**GISphere** is a non-profit initiative led by a group of graduate students and young scholars in GIS-related fields (e.g., remote sensing, urban studies, other subfields in Geography). We have helped students interested in professional development and graduate programs to access the up-to-date information on global M.S./Ph.D. opportunities, funding availabilities, webinars, and competitions through our project website, blogs, online forums, and other virtual events.

Our [Chinese version website](https://www.gisphere.net/) was launched in September 2019 and has achieved great success in China. We have published over 150 blogs with the support of more than 200 volunteers. More than 5,000 students and teachers have benefited from our community. We launched the [English version website](https://gisphere.github.io/) in April 2022 and hope it can help more students applying for GIS-related programs around the world.

In addition, we are developing a brand new website on which graduate school opportunities and academic positions (and any other relevant information and opportunities) in GIS and related fields will be posted in a timely manner. We hope that the resources and experiences shared here can help to foster a stronger global GIS community and empower GIS education for the future. Stay tuned!

<!-- GISphere is a voluntary project started by a group of Chinese young scholars who study GIScience worldwide. GISphere is devoted to bridging the digital and information gap for Chinese undergraduates who major in geography-related majors and help them to access the most up-to-date information on master/PhD opportunities, funding availabilities, webinars, and competitions globally. More than 1,000 students have been benefited from the program.

It is currently only available in Chinese. The English version will be released soon. 

GISphere 留学指南是由全球范围内地理信息科学相关领域的中国青年学者发起的自愿项目，旨在提供全球范围内GIS及相关专业的院校信息，包括各院系的主要科研方向及学位设置等，为相关专业的学生及学者们提供一个关于院校的信息汇总平台，从而加强海内外GIS及相关专业的学术交流与合作，促进学科及产业发展。经历了两年多的发展，前后有超过170位志愿者参与到了内容提供、审核编辑和网站建设等工作，这些志愿者都是全球各地不同院校里相关专业的学生、近期毕业的校友或青年教师。在志愿者们的努力下，指南所覆盖的院校从最初的30多所增长到现在的277所，是目前中文互联网上最大、最全的GIS相关专业的院校指南。 -->
